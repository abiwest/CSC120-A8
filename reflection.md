Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My first overloaded methods are for the House class. I wanted to make a default house when given the name and address that has 4 floors and no elevator or dining hall. I also made a overloaded method for `moveIn` that would let you put in an array of students to move in instead of just one. This made sense as a second method becuase we already have the array of students set up in the beginning of the class but it is unused in this context.

For the Library class, I wanted to make two methods that would let you add or remove an array of books from the library. This could be useful if you were trying to add a whole new series to the library or get rid it. These are overloading the `addTitle` and `removeTitle` functions.

For the cafe class, I put an overloaded class for selling coffee where someone can just order a default black coffee of a certain size without needing to specify milk and sugar amounts. I also did a similar one where someone could just specify the size and amount of cream, and the default sugar would be equal to the amount of cream (e.g. 2 cream, 2 sugar).

When using all of these overloaded methods in the `CampusMap` class, I thought that it all relatively made sense. I was wondering if there was a faster way to do some of it though, becuase I felt like there were still some tedious parts, for example, when I had to create the new students then add them to the array then add them to the house. After completing this assignment, I still feel like I'm not entirely sure how the overloading methods work in terms of order in the program. Is it just that the overloaded one has to be after the original so that it can use the methods from it? Regardless though, I do feel much more comfortable after this assignment implementing different classes to work together, and building off of one another.
